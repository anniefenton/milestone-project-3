# Recipe site

## UX
### Project Goals
Family recipes which are passed through the generations are special, yet are at risk of being lost forever due to the paper-based way they are kept. This site aims to be an alternative to this paper-based storage system and will keep family recipes safe for as long as the user wishes to store them. These recipes deserve to be shared, so users will also be able to view and try other user's family recipes. 

### User Goals
#### _Upload family recipes (Create)_
A user with family recipes would want an easy and simple way to upload their recipes to the site for safe storage. They would want to give data covering the fields of recipe name, the family member they recieved it from, the time it takes to make it, the number of servings, the ingredients, and the method. 

#### _Read other user's family recipes (Read)_
A user would also want to see other user's family recipes to try out themselves or to gain inspiration. 

#### _Edit or update recipes (Update)_
A user may also want to update their recipes, yet not let others update it too. For this functionality, there should be an authentication system allowing users to only update their own recipes. 

#### _Delete recipes (Delete)_
Finally, a user may want to delete a recipe upload. 

### User stories
As someone with lots of family recipes I want:
* A safe space to store them in case my paper-based records get damaged or destroyed
* To be able to edit my records in case I make a mistake or improvement
* To share which of my family members the recipe came from
* For others to be able to see and use my recipe, but not edit or delete them
* To see and use other's family recipes

As someone who is interested in cooking I want:
* Inspiration for my own recipes, and to try out new recipes
* To see what recipes are suitable to my diet type, e.g. vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free
* To be able to create my own profile to share any family recipes I come across.
